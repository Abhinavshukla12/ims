jqGrid is a popular jQuery Plugin for displaying and editing data in tabular form. It has some other more sophisticated features, like subgrids, TreeGrids, grouping and so on.

jqGrid was developed originally by [Tony Tomov](https://github.com/tonytomov) and it was available under MIT/GPL-licenses till the version 4.7.0 published Dec 8, 2014 (see [here](https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid/tree/v4.7.0)). Short time after that the license agreement was changed (see <a href="https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid/commit/1b2cb55c93ee8b279f15a3faf5a2f82a98da3b4c">here</a>) and new 4.7.1 version was <a href="https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid/tree/v4.7.1">published</a>.

The code from the GitHib repository is the fork of jqGrid 4.7.0 - the latest version available under MIT/GPL-licenses. It will be provided under MIT/GPL-licenses.

Below you can find short description of the bug fixes implemented in free jqGrid 4.15.1 (compared with version 4.15.0). The version is developed by [Oleg Kiriljuk](https://github.com/OlegKi), alias [Oleg](https://stackoverflow.com/users/315935/oleg) on the stackoverflow and [OlegK](http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=393) on trirand forum.

Read [Wiki](https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/wiki) for more detailed information about the features of free-jqGrid. The preliminary version of the documentation can be found [here](https://free-jqgrid.github.io/).

Free jqGrid can be used *for free*. We still ask to contribute the development by donating via PayPal, if one have the possibility for it. One can donate by clicking on the following button [![PayPayl donate button](https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/btn/btn_donate_pp_142x27.png)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JGTCBLQM2BYHG "Donate once-off to free jqGrid project using PayPal") or by sending money via PayPal to oleg.kiriljuk@ok-soft-gmbh.com with the comment "free jqGrid". Bank transfer based on the invoice from OK soft GmbH is another option of donating. Just send the email with the information about the amount of donation and you will get the corresponding invoice with the full information about our bank account and our VAT number.

One can install the package with respect of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/free-jqgrid) by using "npm install free-jqgrid", with respect of [bower](https://bower.io/search/?q=free-jqgrid) by using "bower install free-jqgrid" or from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/free-jqGrid) by using "Install-Package free-jqGrid".

The package is published on [WebJars](http://www.webjars.org/) too and it's deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cfree-jqgrid).

Free jqGrid is is available from [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/free-jqgrid) and [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/free-jqgrid). Thus one can use it directly from Internet by including for example the URLs like
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/free-jqgrid@4.15.1/css/ui.jqgrid.min.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/free-jqgrid@4.15.1/js/jquery.jqgrid.min.js"></script>
```
or
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/free-jqgrid/4.15.1/css/ui.jqgrid.min.css">
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/free-jqgrid/4.15.1/jquery.jqgrid.min.js"></script>
```
**The locale file is optional**. One can, but one don't need to include `grid.locale-en.min.js`, because the same information is already included in the `jquery.jqgrid.min.js` (or `jquery.jqgrid.src.js`).

If somebody want to test the *latest* version of free jqGrid, one can load it directly from GitHib using [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/) service:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rawgit.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/master/css/ui.jqgrid.css">
<script src="https://rawgit.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/master/js/jquery.jqgrid.src.js"></script>
```
All other language files and plugins are available from CDN too. See [the wiki article](https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/wiki/Access-free-jqGrid-from-different-CDNs) for more details about the usage of free jqGrid from CDNs and RawGit.

Remark: the above URLs will be available **after publishing** the release of the version of 4.15.1.

### Below one can see the full list of changes in the version 4.15.1 compared with 4.15.0:

* Some changes to allow to use `editoptions.value` as function for `edittype:"select"` or/and `formatter:"select"`. See the comment of [the commit](https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/commit/6c96419a149063492faa47c0a4c74ea915ee06e3) for more information.
* Fixing and extending `free-jqgrid.d.ts` to document the currently implemented features of free jqGrid
* Fix the behavior of `multiselect: true` with `cellEdit: true` if it will be used without new option `noCellSelection: true`
* Fix `columnChooser` to hold first columns having `hidedlg: true` (rownumber, multiselect, formatter: "actions" etc) the first after reordering columns by `columnChooser`
* Fix internal `setNullsOrUnformat` function used in `editGridRow` (form editing) to prevent sending dates if `editable: false`
* Fix auto-resizing for columns which has no compact:true property in `autoResizing`
* Fix the problem with zooming of jqGrid on Android OS in Chrome.
